# Deal-Evaluator Skill Improvements
## Summary of Updates Based on SurveyPlanet Evaluation

**Date:** February 13, 2026  
**Trigger:** SurveyPlanet deal evaluation revealed gaps in systematic evaluation methodology

---

## Key Learnings That Drove Updates

### 1. **ARR vs. Affordability Confusion**
- **Problem:** Hard $180k-$700k ARR range prevented evaluation of $761k ARR deal
- **Root Cause:** Confused revenue target with affordability constraint
- **Solution:** Changed to ARR >$200k (no upper limit) + SDE <$700k for affordability
- **Impact:** Can now properly evaluate larger deals that remain affordable

### 2. **Pricing Opportunities Are Systematic, Not Discovered**
- **Problem:** Treated pricing as one of many opportunities to look for
- **Reality:** For SEO/organic businesses, pricing is THE #1 lever (often untapped)
- **Pattern Discovered:** "Never raised prices" + organic traffic = automatic opportunity
- **Solution:** Created mandatory systematic pricing check with specific triggers
- **Impact:** Will catch major opportunities in first pass instead of later

### 3. **Opaque P&L Line Items Can Hide $200k+ in Savings**
- **Problem:** Didn't immediately flag vague expense items for clarification
- **Example:** $234k "Outside Services" was actually CEO payment
- **Impact:** Changed SDE from 37.7% (FAIL) to 54.2% (PASS)
- **Solution:** Added Step 0 to interrogate P&L before scoring criteria
- **New Process:** Flag items >$50k with vague names, generate Phase 1 questions immediately

### 4. **Declining Growth Needs Context, Not Auto-Fail**
- **Problem:** Would see -8% YoY growth and mark as failing
- **Reality:** Decline can be structural (FAIL) or due to underexecution (OPPORTUNITY)
- **Example:** SurveyPlanet declining 8% BUT never raised prices, never emailed users, cut marketing 95%
- **Solution:** Added context assessment framework to distinguish types of decline
- **Impact:** Won't miss fixable situations with obvious recovery paths

### 5. **Questions Document is Gold Mine**
- **Problem:** Read documents in arbitrary order
- **Reality:** Founder Q&A doc contained data that changed entire evaluation
- **Data Revealed:** MRR trends, cohort retention, churn reasons, untapped opportunities
- **Solution:** Added document reading priority (questions doc FIRST)
- **Impact:** Will catch critical context before forming initial judgment

### 6. **Customer Economics Data Often Missing**
- **Problem:** SIM/P&L don't include churn, cohorts, MRR trends, new customers/month
- **Reality:** These metrics are CRITICAL for evaluation
- **Solution:** Added Part E to check for missing data and generate Phase 1 questions
- **Impact:** Will proactively request essential metrics instead of discovering gaps later

### 7. **"Never Tried X" Requires Nuance**
- **Problem:** Treated all "never tried" equally as PIE-IN-THE-SKY
- **Reality:** "Never emailed existing users" ≠ "Never tried cold outbound"
- **Key Distinction:** Owned vs. unowned distribution channels
- **Solution:** Clarified REAL opportunity = owned channels (email lists, in-product), PIE-IN-THE-SKY = need to build (sales teams)
- **Impact:** Better signal/noise ratio in growth opportunities

### 8. **Competitive Research Must Be Mandatory**
- **Problem:** Treated competitor pricing research as optional
- **Reality:** This single research step changed evaluation from PASS → PURSUE
- **Discovery:** 45-95% underpriced relative to market
- **Solution:** Made competitive research mandatory in Part D
- **Impact:** Will always validate pricing opportunities systematically

### 9. **Team Transition Math Was Hidden**
- **Problem:** CEO comp split across multiple line items ($288k + $234k = $522k)
- **Solution:** Added explicit step to calculate total founder compensation
- **Impact:** Better SDE achievability modeling (25% time + $50k dev vs. full comp)

### 10. **AI Displacement Needs Timeline + Defensibility**
- **Problem:** Would flag "AI can do this" without nuance
- **Reality:** Timeline matters (2-3 years) + distribution moats matter
- **Solution:** Consider both displacement risk AND defensibility (15-year brand, 1M users)
- **Impact:** More balanced risk assessment

---

## Specific Skill Updates Made

### **Section 1: Investment Thesis**
**Changed:**
- ARR: $180k-$700k → ARR >$200k (no upper limit)
- Added: SDE must be <$700k for affordability
- Clarified: ARR can be high if SDE dollars are manageable

**Rationale:** Separated business quality (ARR) from deal affordability (SDE)

---

### **Section 2: Document Reading Priority** (NEW)
**Added entire section** with mandatory reading order:
1. Questions document FIRST (if exists)
2. P&L / Financial statements
3. SIM
4. Other documents

**Rationale:** Questions doc can completely change evaluation outcome

---

### **Section 3: Part A, Step 0 - P&L Interrogation** (ALREADY EXISTED, ENHANCED)
**Added explicit triggers:**
- Line items >$50k with vague names
- Multiple potential founder compensation categories
- Marketing spend inconsistent with organic channels

**Added example:**
- "Outside Services" ($234k): Is this CEO comp? Removable?
- Current SDE: 37.7% vs. Achievable SDE: 54.2%

**Rationale:** Catch economics-changing items before scoring

---

### **Section 4: Part A, Criterion #2 - Growth Rate** 
**Enhanced with context assessment framework:**

**Added: Declining Growth Context Assessment**
- Structural decline (FAIL): Market shrinking, competitor disruption, tech obsolescence
- Underexecution decline (OPPORTUNITY): Never raised prices, never activated channels, founder burnout

**Added examples:**
- -8% YoY + never raised prices + never emailed users = FIXABLE (pass criterion)
- -8% YoY + saturated market + new competitor = STRUCTURAL (fail criterion)

**Rationale:** Don't miss opportunities hidden in decline

---

### **Section 5: Part A, Criterion #3 - SDE Achievability**
**Added explicit founder compensation identification:**
- Officer/Owner salary
- Distributions, draws, bonuses  
- "Consulting," "Outside Services," "Outsourcing" to owner
- Management fees
- **Sum these = Total Founder Compensation**

**Added team restructuring math:**
- Example: $500k total comp → $125k part-time + $50k hire = $350k savings

**Rationale:** Make SDE calculation transparent and accurate

---

### **Section 6: Part C - Systematic Pricing Check** (ENHANCED SIGNIFICANTLY)
**Changed from basic check to 4-step mandatory process:**

**Step 1: Automatic Triggers**
- Last price increase >3 years (or never) = strong signal
- Last increase >5 years = very strong signal
- Customer price complaints <5% = underpricing signal
- Churn reason "price" <10% = pricing power exists

**Step 2: Competitor Pricing Research (MANDATORY)**
- Document 3-5 competitors with pricing tiers
- Compare feature sets
- Calculate price gap: (Competitor - Deal) / Deal × 100%

**Step 3: Categorize Opportunity**
- REAL (HIGH): Competitors 50-100%+ more expensive
- REAL (MEDIUM): Competitors 30-50% more expensive
- PIE-IN-THE-SKY: Competitors 10-30% more expensive
- No Opportunity: At/above market rate

**Step 4: Calculate Impact**
- Current MRR × Price Increase % × 0.95 (assume 5% churn)
- Net ARR impact
- Risk assessment

**Added detailed example:**
```
SYSTEMATIC PRICING CHECK:
- Last increase: Never (15 years) ← Strong signal
- Customer complaints: "Rarely" ← Strong signal
- Organic traffic: 78% ← Price-insensitive customers
- Competitors: +45% to +95% more expensive
- REAL opportunity: $20→$29/mo = +$252k ARR
- Risk: LOW (still cheapest, sticky customers)
```

**Rationale:** Make pricing investigation automatic, not opportunistic

---

### **Section 7: Part C - REAL vs. PIE-IN-THE-SKY Opportunities**
**Added clarification for owned distribution:**

**NEW Category: Untapped Owned Distribution Channels**
- Large email database never contacted (REAL - proven tactic)
- Free users never systematically pitched paid plans (REAL)
- In-product viral loops not optimized (REAL)

**Distinction from speculative:**
- "Never tried outbound sales" = PIE-IN-THE-SKY (need to build)
- "Never emailed existing users" = REAL (channel exists, just activate)

**Rationale:** Better signal/noise in opportunity identification

---

### **Section 8: Part D - Competitive Research** 
**Changed from optional to MANDATORY:**
- Added bold header: "This section is NOT optional"
- Always complete before finalizing evaluation

**Rationale:** Competitive context changes valuation dramatically

---

### **Section 9: Part E - Customer Economics** (NEW SECTION)
**Added entire section** to check for missing data:

**Required Data Points:**
1. New customers per month
2. Churn rate (monthly/annual %)
3. Cohort retention (12-month)
4. MRR trend (last 12 months)
5. Customer segments (behavior by size)
6. Upgrade path data (conversion rates)

**If missing: Generate Phase 1 email questions**

**Rationale:** Can't fully assess without cohort/churn data

---

### **Section 10: Critical Reminders** (ENHANCED)
**Added new reminders:**

1. **"Questions document changes everything"**
   - Read first, can flip PASS → PURSUE
   - Contains MRR, churn, cohorts often missing elsewhere

2. **"Declining growth needs context"**
   - Structural decline = fail
   - Underexecution decline = opportunity
   - Example: -8% + never raised prices = fixable

3. **"'Never raised prices' is massive red flag"**
   - For undermonetization (positive signal)
   - If <5% customer complaints, pricing power exists

4. **"P&L clarifications can swing SDE 20+ points"**
   - Example provided: 37.7% → 54.2%

**Rationale:** Encode highest-leverage learnings as heuristics

---

### **Section 11: Edge Cases**
**Added new edge case:**

**"ARR above target range but SDE is affordable"**
- $761k ARR with $412k SDE = GOOD FIT
- $500k ARR with $800k SDE = TOO EXPENSIVE
- Constraint is SDE dollars, not ARR
- Always calculate SDE in dollars, not just %

**Rationale:** Don't auto-reject larger deals if affordable

---

## Quantitative Impact

### Before vs. After Skill Updates

**SurveyPlanet Deal:**
- **Before Updates:** Would have been AUTO-PASS
  - Failed 3 of 5 criteria (ARR too high, growth negative, unclear SDE)
  - Pricing opportunity not systematically checked
  - Would have stopped evaluation early
  
- **After Updates:** Became PURSUE
  - Passed 3 of 5 criteria (ARR acceptable if SDE affordable, growth fixable)
  - Systematic pricing check revealed +$252k ARR opportunity
  - P&L interrogation revealed 54.2% achievable SDE
  - Questions doc revealed validated opportunities
  - **Composite Score: 68% (17/25)**

**Improvement:** Skill would now correctly evaluate deals that old version would miss

---

## Testing the Updates

### Hypothetical Test Case 1: "High ARR, Low SDE Deal"
**Scenario:** $900k ARR, $600k SDE (66% margin)
- **Old Skill:** Would flag as "ARR too high, outside range"
- **New Skill:** ARR acceptable, SDE affordable, PASSES criterion #1 ✓

### Hypothetical Test Case 2: "Declining Growth Deal"
**Scenario:** Revenue -10% YoY, but never raised prices in 8 years, competitors charge 2x more
- **Old Skill:** Would auto-fail on growth criterion
- **New Skill:** Context assessment → underexecution decline → PASSES with pricing opportunity ✓

### Hypothetical Test Case 3: "Opaque P&L Deal"
**Scenario:** P&L shows $300k "Consulting Fees"
- **Old Skill:** Would calculate SDE including this cost (might fail SDE threshold)
- **New Skill:** Flags in Step 0, generates Phase 1 question, calculates range (worst/best case) ✓

### Hypothetical Test Case 4: "Questions Doc Exists"
**Scenario:** Three documents provided: SIM, P&L, "Founder Q&A.docx"
- **Old Skill:** Would read in arbitrary order, might miss critical context
- **New Skill:** Reads Q&A first, catches MRR decline, churn data, opportunities ✓

---

## Success Metrics

**A successful skill update should:**
- ✅ Reduce false negatives (missing good deals like SurveyPlanet)
- ✅ Maintain high bar (not lowering standards, just better context)
- ✅ Catch opportunities systematically (pricing, email, partnerships)
- ✅ Generate better Phase 1 questions (P&L clarity, customer economics)
- ✅ Provide clearer reasoning (context for decisions)

**Measurement:**
- If Pascal reviews evaluation and says "this is what I would have concluded," skill is working
- If evaluation catches something Pascal missed, skill is exceeding expectations
- If evaluation misses something Pascal caught, skill needs refinement

---

## Open Questions / Future Improvements

1. **AI Displacement Risk Assessment:**
   - Need more nuanced framework for "how soon?" and "how defensible?"
   - Current: Binary flag, could be multi-factor scoring

2. **Churn Acceptability Thresholds:**
   - What churn rate is acceptable for different business models?
   - SaaS: 5-7% monthly typical
   - Need category-specific benchmarks

3. **Team Transition Feasibility:**
   - How to assess "can founder really go 25% time?"
   - Need heuristics for critical founder knowledge vs. transferable

4. **Price Increase Shock Assessment:**
   - 45% increase might lose more than 5% of customers
   - Need cohort-based modeling: Long-term customers (sticky) vs. new customers (churn-prone)

5. **Competitive Moat Evaluation:**
   - Currently lightweight assessment
   - Could use Porter's Five Forces or other framework

---

## Conclusion

The SurveyPlanet evaluation revealed that the original deal-evaluator skill was too rigid in criteria application and missed systematic opportunities (especially pricing). The updated skill now:

1. **Separates affordability from ARR** (can evaluate larger deals)
2. **Makes pricing investigation mandatory** (catches undermonetization)
3. **Adds P&L interrogation step** (catches hidden economics)
4. **Contextualizes declining growth** (distinguishes fixable from structural)
5. **Prioritizes questions documents** (catches critical data first)
6. **Flags missing customer economics** (generates better Phase 1 questions)
7. **Distinguishes owned vs. unowned channels** (better opportunity signal)

**Net Result:** More accurate evaluations, fewer false negatives, better prioritization.

**Validation:** Would have correctly evaluated SurveyPlanet as PURSUE (68% composite score) instead of AUTO-PASS.
