# Learnings from Deal Evaluations

Accumulated insights and pattern recognition from real deal evaluations.

## Evaluation History

### Evalart (Acquired)
**Date:** 2023  
**Outcome:** Acquired for ~$520k  
**Key Learnings:**
- LatAm focus defensible (language, payment methods, cultural differences)
- ATS integration strategy validated
- High Capterra ratings (4.8*) correlated with customer retention

### SurveyPlanet (Evaluated February 2026)
**Date:** 2026-02-13  
**Outcome:** Evaluation changed from PASS → PURSUE after deep analysis  
**Key Learnings:**

1. **Never-raised prices in 15 years = massive opportunity**
   - Pattern: Organic/SEO businesses undermonetize systematically
   - Competitive research revealed 45-95% underpricing
   - Validated +$252k ARR opportunity from single pricing change

2. **P&L line items can hide $200k+ in economics**
   - $234k "Outside Services" was CEO compensation
   - Changed SDE from 37.7% (FAIL) → 54.2% (PASS)
   - Learning: Always interrogate vague expenses >$50k before scoring

3. **Declining growth requires context**
   - -8% YoY growth initially seemed fatal
   - Deep dive revealed: Never raised prices, never emailed users, cut marketing 95%
   - These are FIXABLE underexecution issues, not structural decline
   - Learning: Ask "WHY declining?" not just "IS IT declining?"

4. **Questions document contains gold**
   - Founder Q&A revealed MRR trends, churn data, untapped opportunities
   - Changed entire evaluation trajectory
   - Learning: Always read questions doc FIRST if exists

5. **"Never tried X" needs nuance**
   - "Never emailed 1M user database" = REAL opportunity (owned channel)
   - "Never tried outbound sales" = PIE-IN-THE-SKY (unowned channel)
   - Learning: Distinguish owned vs. unowned distribution

6. **Customer complaints <5% = pricing power**
   - Founder: "We rarely get complaints about pricing"
   - Organic traffic (78%) = price-insensitive customers
   - Learning: Low complaint rate + organic acquisition = can raise prices aggressively

7. **AI displacement timeline matters**
   - Survey tools ARE vulnerable to LLMs
   - But 15-year brand + 1M users + organic traffic = defensible for 2-3 years
   - Learning: Don't just flag AI risk, assess timeline AND moat

## Pattern Recognition

### Underpricing Signals (High Confidence)
- ✅ Last price increase >3 years ago
- ✅ Customer complaints about price <5%
- ✅ >70% organic/SEO traffic (price-insensitive)
- ✅ Competitors 50%+ more expensive for similar value
- ✅ Founder says "we're the cheapest option"

**Action:** Automatic pricing opportunity investigation

### Hidden SDE Red Flags
- 🚩 "Outside Services" or "Consulting" >$100k
- 🚩 "Outsourcing" or "Contract Labor" with no details
- 🚩 Officer Salary + Other Large Expense = Suspiciously high
- 🚩 Missing expected expenses (no hosting for SaaS?)

**Action:** Generate Phase 1 P&L clarification questions immediately

### Underexecution vs. Structural Decline
**Underexecution (Fixable):**
- Never raised prices while competitors did
- Never activated obvious channels (email, partnerships)
- Declining marketing spend without replacement
- Founder burnout / reduced time investment

**Structural (Fatal):**
- Competitor disruption (cheaper/better product launched)
- Market shrinking (category search volume down)
- Technology obsolescence (Flash in 2020)
- Regulatory changes

**Test:** Google Trends for category keywords, competitor research

### Strong Distribution Moats
- Existing partnerships generating 30%+ of leads
- Viral product mechanics (survey completions → sign-ups)
- Embedded in workflows (ATS integration)
- Geographic advantage (only Spanish/Portuguese option)

**Valuation Impact:** Justifies premium pricing multiple

## Common Mistakes (Pre-Framework Update)

### ❌ Mistake 1: Auto-failing on ARR >$700k
**Problem:** Confused ARR target with affordability  
**Fix:** Changed to ARR >$200k, SDE <$700k  
**Example:** SurveyPlanet $761k ARR but $412k SDE = affordable

### ❌ Mistake 2: Treating all growth decline equally
**Problem:** -8% YoY seen as automatic failure  
**Fix:** Added context assessment (structural vs. underexecution)  
**Example:** SurveyPlanet declining but fixable

### ❌ Mistake 3: Not systematically checking pricing
**Problem:** Missed 45-95% underpricing opportunity  
**Fix:** Made pricing check mandatory with automatic triggers  
**Example:** SurveyPlanet pricing opportunity = $252k ARR

### ❌ Mistake 4: Accepting P&L at face value
**Problem:** Didn't flag vague expenses for clarification  
**Fix:** Added Step 0 to interrogate unclear line items  
**Example:** $234k "Outside Services" changed entire economics

### ❌ Mistake 5: Reading documents in random order
**Problem:** Missed critical context in questions doc  
**Fix:** Document reading priority (questions first)  
**Example:** SurveyPlanet Q&A revealed everything

## Sector-Specific Insights

### Pre-Employment Assessment Tools
- **Competition:** Very crowded market (TestGorilla, Codility, HackerRank, etc.)
- **Differentiation:** Geography (LatAm) or niche (technical + soft skills)
- **Pricing:** Wide range ($20-200/mo per seat)
- **AI Risk:** HIGH for automated grading, MEDIUM for test creation
- **Key Success Factor:** ATS integrations drive 30%+ of revenue

### Survey/Form Tools
- **Competition:** Dominated by SurveyMonkey, Typeform, Google Forms
- **Differentiation:** Unlimited features (vs. paywalled) or specialization
- **Pricing:** $20-70/mo for pro plans
- **AI Risk:** HIGH for survey creation/analysis (2-3 year horizon)
- **Key Success Factor:** Distribution moat (viral loops, embedded in workflows)

## Framework Improvements Needed

### 1. AI Displacement Risk Framework
**Current:** Binary flag (yes/no)  
**Needed:** Multi-factor scoring
- Displacement timeline (6mo, 1yr, 2yr, 5yr+)
- Defensibility factors (brand, distribution, data moat)
- Category-specific vulnerabilities

### 2. Churn Benchmarks by Category
**Current:** No specific thresholds  
**Needed:** Category benchmarks
- B2B SaaS: 5-7% monthly acceptable
- Prosumer tools: 10-15% monthly acceptable
- Consumer: 20%+ monthly common
- Need to flag abnormal churn for category

### 3. Team Transition Heuristics
**Current:** Vague guidance on founder replaceability  
**Needed:** Structured assessment
- Founder technical depth (10+ years = hard to replace)
- Knowledge documentation state
- Team bench strength
- Customer relationship dependency

### 4. Price Increase Shock Modeling
**Current:** Assumes flat 5% churn  
**Needed:** Cohort-based modeling
- Long-term customers (2+ years): 0-2% churn
- Medium-term (6-24 months): 5-10% churn
- New customers (<6 months): 15-25% churn
- Weighted average for realistic impact

### 5. Competitive Moat Assessment
**Current:** Lightweight narrative  
**Needed:** Structured framework
- Network effects (0-10)
- Switching costs (0-10)
- Brand strength (0-10)
- Proprietary data/tech (0-10)
- Distribution (0-10)
- Composite moat score

## Deal Volume Insights

**Current State (Feb 2026):**
- Evaluating ~1-2 deals per week
- 80% are AUTO-PASS (fail multiple criteria)
- 15% are borderline (3-4 criteria)
- 5% are strong candidates (4-5 criteria + opportunities)

**Framework Stability:**
- v1.0 → v2.0 required major update (SurveyPlanet learnings)
- Expect v2.0 stable for next 10-15 evaluations
- Small refinements expected, no major overhauls

**Agent Migration Trigger:**
- Will consider sub-agent when evaluating 5+ deals/week
- Need 20+ evaluations to validate v2.0 framework
- Estimate: 6-12 months at current volume

## Questions for Future Research

1. **Does founder involvement correlate with success?**
   - Evalart: Founder stayed on 25% time, successful
   - Need more data points

2. **How predictive are high review scores?**
   - Evalart: 4.8* Capterra, strong retention
   - SurveyPlanet: High scores despite basic UI
   - Hypothesis: High scores + organic growth = strong PMF

3. **What churn rate predicts success?**
   - Need to collect churn data on all evaluations
   - Build dataset: Churn rate vs. outcome

4. **Do pricing increases actually work?**
   - SurveyPlanet opportunity modeled, not executed
   - Need post-acquisition validation

5. **How accurate are our PURSUE/PASS calls?**
   - Need to track: Deals we passed that succeeded elsewhere
   - Deals we pursued that struggled

## Action Items

- [ ] Track all PURSUE/PASS decisions with rationale
- [ ] Follow up on passed deals (did they sell? for how much?)
- [ ] Collect post-acquisition metrics (churn, growth, SDE)
- [ ] Build evaluation dataset for ML/pattern recognition (future)
- [ ] Quarterly framework review incorporating new learnings
