# Competitive Researcher Skill

**Version:** 1.0

## Purpose

Identify 3–5 direct competitors for a micro-SaaS product, research their current pricing, and produce a structured pricing comparison table with gap analysis.

## Inputs

- **Company name** — the acquisition target
- **Product category** — what type of software (e.g., "survey tools", "pre-employment assessment", "project management")
- **Business description** — 1-2 sentences on what the product does
- **Current pricing** (optional) — target company's pricing if known from documents

## Process

### Step 1: Identify competitors
Search for "[product category] software competitors" and "[company name] alternatives". Focus on:
- Direct competitors: same category, same customer segment (SMB vs. enterprise)
- 3 competitors minimum, 5 maximum
- Prioritize tools with pricing pages and G2/Capterra listings

### Step 2: Research pricing
For each competitor:
1. Visit their pricing page
2. Record all plan tiers, monthly price, annual price, key features
3. If pricing requires login or is "contact sales" — note as "pricing not public"
4. Cross-reference with G2/Capterra review mentions for pricing signals

### Step 3: Build comparison table
Structure: competitor name | entry price | pro/growth price | enterprise | key differentiator

### Step 4: Gap analysis
- Calculate: where does the target sit in the pricing range?
- Flag: any competitor 50%+ more expensive than target = PRICING OPPORTUNITY (HIGH confidence)
- Note: is the target the cheapest option in the market?

## Outputs

- Competitor table (3–5 rows)
- Pricing range summary (market low / market high / target position)
- Pricing opportunity flag (YES/NO with evidence)
- Notes on any data gaps

## Failure Modes

| Situation | Response |
|---|---|
| Fewer than 3 direct competitors found | Note niche market, list what's available, search adjacent categories |
| Pricing not public for most competitors | Use review sites for pricing signals, note low confidence |
| Company too new / no G2 presence | Use web search for press mentions and pricing |
| Target company has no listed pricing | Note as "pricing not public" — this itself is a signal |
